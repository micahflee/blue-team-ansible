# Blue Team Ansible

Ansible playbooks for spinning up infrastructure and defending networks in attack/defense CTF.
I'm using DigitalOcean to deploy new infrastructure.

## Getting Started

Create a python2 virtual environment and install dependencies:

```
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To leave the virtual env:

```
(venv) $ deactivate
```

Make sure to be in your virtual env when running these ansible playbooks.
